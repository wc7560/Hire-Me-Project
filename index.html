        <p class="para1">I feel like I have been interested in code ever since I was in about 6th grade. I never really got into actually learning how to code until recently because it alway seemed so intimidating. Another reason why is because I am a very lazy person and there weren't a lot of opportunities for my age. Some programs either said I was to young or too old. I feel like coding is super cool and important and I like being a part of that.</p>
